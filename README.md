# Student Performance in Portuguese & Math
In this notebook, we use machine learning models to predict future student performance while also taking a look at different ways of data visualization and model explainability. 

You can view the data <a href ="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance">here</a>. It was taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Data repository.
